# Topological Defects

An introductory *Living Book* on topics in astrophysical topology, with focus on cosmic strings.

This book contains preliminary notes and prerequisite overviews of the relevant mathematical concepts.

Coherency and chronology is something this book will struggle with initially. This is because I am in part using this book as an excuse to formalize the notes I have at home (the pandemic has seperated me from the rest for nearly a year now). 

Topics, consequently, will range from basic to advanced without a clear path. This is something I will ammend once the scope of the book is realized -- I fully expect to strip down most of what I write, but that is in the interest of eventually having a concise and thorough introduction to the wonderful world of astrophysical topologies.
